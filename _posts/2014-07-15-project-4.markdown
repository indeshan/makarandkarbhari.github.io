description: Challenge- To get the transformation of the camera with respect to end-effector of the robotic manipulator.
description2: Solution- Various transformation techniques were investigated. Optimal technique was selected based on the design constraints for the camera.
description3: Result- The intrinsic and extrinsic parameters for the camera were calculated. The iteration technique was used where a checkerboard was mounted on robotic arm’s end-effector and moved through to obtain different posses. The difference between the position of detected checkerboard and checkerboard projected into the camera image is minimized to find the transformation. Min ||𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑚(𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑) − 𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑚(𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑)|| ≤ 𝑆𝑒𝑡 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒.
